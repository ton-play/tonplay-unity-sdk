# TON Play Unity SDK

TON Play allows developers to add blockchain elements to any mobile or web game. Additionally, you can port any web game to launch directly inside Telegram via a Web App.

This SDK allows you to get assets related to your game and to a user. Also, you can create an in-game marketplace, so your users can put assets on sale, remove from sale, get assets on sale and sell assets. 

Moreover, this SDK includes two React wrappers: 
1. to optimize the way you launch the game in iFrame or WebApp/WebView
2. to open external links (for example, invite links or signing transactions)
